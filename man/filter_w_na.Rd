\title{Filter with a condition but keep rows that are NA}
\usage{
filter_w_na(df, condition)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data.frame.}

\item{condition}{A logical expression to filter by (passed to `filter()`).}
}
\value{
A filtered data.frame that includes rows matching the condition
  AND rows where the condition was `NA`.
}
\description{
This function mimics `dplyr::filter()` but includes an `is.na()` check,
ensuring that rows where the condition evaluates to `NA` are kept
instead of being dropped.
}
