\alias{mutate_bar}
\title{Perform a rowwise mutate with a progress bar}
\usage{
mutate_bar(.data, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{A data.frame.}

\item{...}{One or more named expressions to be passed to `mutate()`.}
}
\value{
A data.frame with the new/modified columns, ungrouped from the
  `rowwise()` operation.
}
\description{
This function wraps `dplyr::mutate()` and forces `rowwise()` execution,
inserting a `progress::progress_bar$tick()` into the *first*
expression. This is useful for long-running rowwise operations
like API calls or complex string calculations.
}
\details{
The progress bar tick is only added to the first expression.
  All expressions are evaluated in order by `mutate()`.
